Notes to Color 1.0.0
The program will convert a melody to a color. The algorithm is based
on the theory that associates the 7 notes with the 7 colors of the
rainbow. Then the colors corresponding to the notes are mixed by
averaging their HSV values.
INSTRUCTIONS:
- The program starts with a console window with the prompt
“Note: “ and a small GUI window displaying the color. It might
be necessary to move aside the color display window to free
the console window and make both windows visible.
- Input a melody by typing individual notes in lowercase letter
notation (i.e. g, g, a, g, c, b) and pressing Enter after each
note. The program only understands diatonic notes on the C
major scale (no # or b).
- As you input notes, the color display window will update with
the color calculated so far.
- The console window will display the color in HEX format and
a list of the notes followed by number of occurrences and
percent so far.
- You can export the color to another application through the
HEX value or through a screenshot of the color display window.
- Type “new” (+Enter) to input a new melody.
- Type “quit” (+Enter) to quit the program.
