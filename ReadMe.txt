Notes to Color 1.0.3

The program will convert a melody to a color. The algorithm is based
on the theory that associates the 7 notes with the 7 colors of the
rainbow. Then the colors corresponding to the notes are mixed by
averaging their RGB values.

INSTRUCTIONS:

- Write your melody in a text file in letter notation (A,B,C,D…) in 
lowercase or uppercase letters. Separate each note with one space.
- Drag and drop the text file icon on the file program.
- Alternatively you can write your melody in a file named melody.txt
and just start the program.
- A window will open, with a square area displaying the color and two
text boxes with the RGB and HEX values of the color.
- You can copy the HEX value for export in another program through
the Copy menu that appears by right clicking on the text box.
- If no text file is dragged and dropped and no file named melody.txt
is found, the program will crash.
- The program understands # notes but not flat ones, so Db (flat)
Becomes C#, and so on.

New in this version:

- understands # notes
